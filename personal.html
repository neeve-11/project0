        <span>no deadlines until death</span>
        <p>for now, I am leading a very relaxed and comfortable life.Nothing to worry about.Just doing the thing that want
        for myself.No one schedules my day,I am the one who dictates everything in a day.It feels great to not to have any exams
        and no deadline for the project that I am working right now.I can take up as much time as I want,which is a great relief.But,I
        do think this slows dowm my learning process.Though,I could not figure doing something with no deadline is boon or bane.Well....
        I am really enjoying and itzz pretty awesome.</p><br>
        <span>guilty pleasure</span>
        <p>billions of people are dieing and most are going through their toughest times of their lives.Here I am, writing in a webpage
        saying that this is one of the best phase of my life.</p><br>
        <span>hoping - everytime turns around the way I wish </span>
        <p><strong>long term wish :</strong>I should be decent a professional at my domain(keeping pace with recent technologies).I will be really
        disappointed if I am not and I will strive hard to be one(I guess mu statergies will work).<br>
        <strong>short term </strong> first and formost not to waste time.stick to the plan.Not to get excited when you finish a part of the project,
        so remind yourself job is done only when you finish the web development course and it needs to finsihed within this lockdown.Remember that
        you have way too long path to master in this field and never give up,because it is difficult.Always enjoy the process learning, it helps
        to be persist and ignites the hunger to learn more. </p><br>
        <span>my thoughts for now</span>
        <p>I thought of writing a lot on this page.As I lagging a lot as per my plan,I didn't write what I wanted
        to.Just blaberring to something to fill up the page.I wanted a lot in this page and it didn't come out as expected.So,for now
        I am contended that the contents in the page are my own.</p><br>
